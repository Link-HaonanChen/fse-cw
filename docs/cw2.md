#Report for Coursework 2
##Brief Introduction
The following report will discuss in detail about **specification generating** and **modelling process** for building a personal financial management system. The **prototypes** ...... The **activity diagram** illustrates different conditions the management system may meet as well as decisions will be made, and step-by-step procedure of different chioces of managing users' finance. The **Scenarios** ......

Contents are as follows:
- [1. Prototype](#1-prototype)
- [2. Activity diagram](#2-activity-diagram)
- [3. Scenarios](#3-scenarios)

## 2. Activity diagram
- ### Reasoning for why it is chosen
> We choose to use activity diagram to illustrate how different kinds of users can manage their financial accounts simply by using this managements system with several functions that meet their requirements. 
> Initially, I need to confirm what kind of user I am. If I am a single-account-single-customer (condition: if a single-account-single-customer or multi-account-user or joint-account-user?), then I will be able to choose among three basic functions that serve well for managing (condition: if choose to know how much spend or spare budget or categorised data). 
> If, in one case, I choose to know how much I spend, I can simply get the total money that system returns. Then I can choose whether to know how much spent on fun casual things (condition: if show fun casual spending?). 
> If, in aother case, I choose to know an available spare budget for me, the system will first figure out the total available amount of money. Whenever I spent money, the system will subtract that amount from this amount (consition: if spend money?). If I have categories that are variable but definitely scheduled to go out (condition: if definitely scheduled but variable?), the system will set an average of usual cost for those categories, and update it when it is actually spent. After this, the spare money colunm will be changed positively or negatively (condition: if the variable one out of teh set average amount?). If I decided to set some kinds of monery aside, The system will subtract certain kinds of spending from this "set-aside", innstead of the total one. Then I can see a total of how much is exactly fixed to date in this month.
> If, in other case, I choose to see categorised data, the system will first copy every expenditure into a saperate sheet. Then it collects the data of these expenditures. Finally, spendings will be caterorised into default categories. If something need to go to a different category instead of default (condition: if a expenditure has different purpose?), I can change it for a transaction. After all I can see the totals for categories or types (condition: if see categorised or typed?).
> Apart from these basic functions, several features are provided if I am not just a single-account-single-customer. If I am a multi-account user, I can see summary for each individual account or accross all accounts (consition: if see single or total?). 
> If I am a joint-account user, the system will note every amount of money with the person who spent it. Then I can see who spent certain money.
> If I want to use other functions, I can go back to choose another choice for management.
> Throughout this process, many choices are provided by the system and step-by-step actions are involved. With an activity diagram, it clearly shows how the whole checking and recording proccess flows and how financial management decisions are made in different conditions
