### 1. Brief Introduction
> - This software is for personal finance management using data directly from their accounts in other application. People can use it to record how they spend money for different categories or different things. Then they can see clearly their income and expenses and set a set-aside amount for various use.The diagrams below shows the requirements Textual Analysis, 6 Personas, and a Use Case Diagram.
> - The reason why we do not choose the user stories is:  
> >  1. The requirement of application is relatively specific in this case.  However, user story only indicates the requirement generally, it does not show the specification.  
> >  2. The logic of user story is from buttom to top, which will omit some specificrequirement of customer.


### 2. Textual Analysis
>- Here is the Textual Analysis of requirements. Actors and Use Cases have been identified.

### 3. Persona

The reason why we choose Personas is that amont all the three chioces, the use of persona is unavoidable.
User Story derives from the Personas, therefore whatever our choice is, we need Personas to analysis this issue.
Compared with User Stroy, the Personas contains some typical potential clients who could provide most of the cases we need to cope with when developing our software.
As the junior stage of development, the Personas is capable to satisfy our demand to simulate the problem. 

>- [Here is the Personas](/docs/cw1_personas.md)
**Introduction to the Personas**
This Personas contains 6 personas classified by their account status, which are repectively 3 single-account-single-customers, 2 Multi-account-users and 1 Joint-account user.
Generally, this allocation ia based on the proprotion of users in real world.
The main point of the Personas is the users' information which we think is likely to effect their income and expention, 
which relates to the prime function of our software.
Basically, we take the nation, age, occupancy into the consideration of the selection of users in the Personas.
We mainly focus on the users' Financial, Life Status. We think it is the primary factor of their consumption habits.
Then we list some consomption habits of the users, by which we could simulate the finantial activities of users and the performance of the software.
This leads to the further details of the development. 
Fianlly, we assumpt some requirements of the users, which we think could be used for further development, such as the User Story.
All essential information required for the development of this software and the discussion with our clients is included in the Personas. 


### 4. Use Case Diagram
> - Here is the Use Case Diagram of the requirements.
> Reason to choose use case diagram is:
> > 1. In this case, the customers provide specific requirement. Therefore, compared to user story, use case diagram is suitable to the case, which can clearly shows the detail through use case.
> > 2. Use case diagram is better to show the function of application with multiple actors and use cases.
> > 3. It also help software engineers build the program with specific requirement.
> > 3. Use case diagram enables us to model system functions as well as actors that actors interact with those function.
> > 4. This diagram provides a complete and global view of how this system works along with several modules that helps understand detailed tasks.
> > 5. It also provides a legible way for customer to get clearly classified actions that are aimed to accomplish, as well as actions that are not provided which allows reader to point out more functions that this system is required to do.
> > 6. All of this means more easily organizing further requirement engineering.
