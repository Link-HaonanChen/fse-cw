### 1. Brief Introduction
> - This software is for personal finance management using data directly from their accounts in other application. People can use it to record how they spend money for different categories or different things. Then they can see clearly their income and expenses and set a set-aside amount for various use.The diagrams below shows the requirements Textual Analysis, 6 Personas, and a Use Case Diagram.
> - The reason why we do not choose the user stories is:  
        
        >- 1.the requirement of application is relatively specific in this case.  However, user story only indicates the requirement generally, it does not show the specification.  
        
        >- 2.the logic of user story is from buttom to top, which will omit some specificrequirement of customer.



### 2. Textual Analysis
>- Here is the Textual Analysis of requirements. Actors and Use Cases have been identified.

### 3. Persona

The reason why we choose Personas is that amont all the three chioces, the use of persona is unavoidable.
User Story derives from the Personas, therefore whatever our choice is, we need Personas to analysis this issue.
Compared with User Stroy, the Personas contains some typical potential clients who could provide most of the cases we need to cope with when developing our software.
As the junior stage of development, the Personas is capable to satisfy our demand to simulate the problem. 

>- Here is the Personas.

### 4. Use Case Diagram
>- Here is the Use Case Diagram of the requirements.
Reason to choose use case diagram is:
1.in this case, the customers provide specific requirement. Therefore, compared to user story, use case diagram is suitable to the case, which can clearly shows the detail through use case.
2.use case diagram is better to show the function of application with multiple actors and use cases.
3.it also help software engineers build the program with specific requirement.
